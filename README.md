How to contribute to TodayPlus

One major way you can contribute is to report any issues you find with TodayPlus on Github and being as verbose as you can be for us to replicate the issue. This goes a long way in making TodayPlus better for everyone on every type of set up.

Another way is to contribute your own code via Pull Requests. Here are some notes on how to do that.

Fork the repository on GitHub into your own account
Create your own branch git checkout -b your-branch-name
Update your code and push those code changes back to your fork's branch git push origin your-branch-name
Submit a Pull Request using that branch
And please accept our thanks!
This makes it easy for us to test your code locally and also allows the community to have a discussion around it.
